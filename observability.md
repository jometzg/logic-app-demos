# Observability
It is important to understand what is happening both with logic apps and the other services that may be used alongside logic apps to achieve a specific integration scenario.

Observability is the general term for this and it covers:
1. logs generated by the logic apps and therefore any errors too
2. Metrics generated by the logic apps, which are useful for diagnosing peformance related concerns
3. Dashboards for an at-a-glance view of the state of an integration
4. Alerts - these can be generated if some threshold gets exceeded and should be limited to situations where someone needs to take some action - hence the phrase *actionable alerts*

## Azure Portal observability
By default, logic apps capture a *run history* that gives a view on all of the logic app runs. These runs are categorised into successful and unsuccessful - where there has been a failure on one or more steps. These can be clicked in the portal to see the cause and are a useful debugging aid. These are primarily useful in the development stages, but for later production use, it could be that the run history in the Azure Portal is not available to those who need to operationally manager or there may be simply too many logic app runs for this to be useful.
