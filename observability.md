# Observability
It is important to understand what is happening both with logic apps and the other services that may be used alongside logic apps to achieve a specific integration scenario.

Observability is the general term for this and it covers:
1. logs generated by the logic apps and therefore any errors too
2. Metrics generated by the logic apps, which are useful for diagnosing peformance related concerns
3. Dashboards for an at-a-glance view of the state of an integration
4. Alerts - these can be generated if some threshold gets exceeded and should be limited to situations where someone needs to take some action - hence the phrase *actionable alerts*
